Hello Connections! 👋
I'm Shaif Khan, and I’m thrilled to introduce one of my most exciting AI-powered creations — a multi-functional chatbot built using Rasa Framework and Python, integrated with Telegram to assist users in:

🛍 Choosing the right smartphones/laptops
📰 Staying updated with the latest tech news
🧘‍♂️ Interacting emotionally through a Mood Bot feature

This project merges Conversational AI, natural language understanding (NLU), and Telegram integration — all deployed from a local setup using Ngrok. It's a full-stack chatbot that showcases the future of interactive AI assistants.

💻 Tech Stack & Tools:

          🔹 Rasa (NLU + Core) – For intent classification and dialogue management
          
          🔹 Python – Backend logic and custom actions
          
          🔹 HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend interaction for web interface
          
          🔹 Ngrok – Secure tunnel to expose local Rasa server to Telegram
          
          🔹 Telegram Bot API – For real-time chatbot communication
          
          🔹 📦 Libraries: TensorFlow, ujson, requests, and more
          
          🔹 ⚙️ Dev Tools: Anaconda, C++ Build Tools, virtual environments

🧠 Core Chatbot Capabilities:

          🗣️ NLP-powered Intent Recognition via trained stories and utterances
          
          🛒 Product Recommendation: Suggests phones/laptops based on user needs
          
          📰 Tech News Fetcher: Responds with trending news snippets
          
          😇 Mood Bot: Replies empathetically to emotional cues
          
          💬 Telegram Integration: Works inside the Telegram app in real time
          
          🌐 Frontend-Friendly: Optional UI with HTML + JS for web interaction

🛠️ Development Highlights:

          ✅ Custom NLU pipelines for better accuracy
          
          ✅ Fallback & error-handling policies for smooth conversations
          
          ✅ Telegram connector with live updates via Ngrok
          
          ✅ Lightweight & modular project structure
          
          ✅ Fully offline-ready using Anaconda environments

💡 Why This Project Stands Out:
Whether you're diving into Conversational AI, exploring Rasa, or building real-time Telegram bots, this project offers a complete blueprint — from intent design to deployment — that’s both scalable and user-friendly.

It’s a blend of AI, backend engineering, and chatbot UX, and perfect for anyone interested in real-world NLP projects.
